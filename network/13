# Not sure what they really want from us but maybe this:
host $(sudo ifconfig | awk ' /broadcast/{ print $2 } ') | awk ' { print $5 } '

# Some options to find machine's self-assigned name:
#
# On Linux:
#
# hostname
# cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname
#
# On Windows:
#
# ipconfig /all | findstr /C:"Host Name"
